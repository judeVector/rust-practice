# Rust Practice and Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Rust Practice and Learning Repository**! 🚀

This repository is a collection of my Rust programming exercises, experiments, and projects. It serves as a personal playground to explore the diverse capabilities of Rust, including but not limited to game development, networking, blockchain, and other exciting domains. I will continue updating this repository as I progress on my Rust journey.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here


* **Networking**:
  * Learning to build robust and efficient network applications.
  * Concepts like TCP/UDP sockets, REST APIs, and more.
* **Blockchain Development**:
  * Smart contract development
  * Building blockchain components and primitives
  * Exploring Web3 libraries and tools in Rust
  * Implementation of consensus mechanisms
* **General Rust Practice**:
  * Basic to advanced Rust concepts.
  * Structs, enums, error handling, ownership, concurrency, and more.
* **Game Development**:
  * Experiments with creating games using Rust.
  * Exploration of Rust libraries like `bevy`, `ggez`, or custom implementations.

## 📝 Why This Repo?

This repository tracks my progress and serves as a reference for anyone:
* Learning Rust alongside me.
* Curious about how to use Rust in practical scenarios.
* Looking for beginner-to-intermediate Rust code examples.

## 🔄 Updates

I'll be regularly adding new examples, projects, and experiments as I learn more about Rust's powerful ecosystem.
